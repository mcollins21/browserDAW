# browserDAW

This web application is being developed as part of an independent-study project by Michael Collins for Loyola University Chicago. All audio samples that are used during development have been sourced from Freesound. Any question or concerns can be forwarded on to mcollins21@luc.edu.


Current Development Status:

This semester I was able to Explore the world of web audio specifically the web audio API of Tone.JS. As a present, I have been working on the functionality of the sample playback buttons which would be integrated into a master transport so that users can collectively play samples separately or at the same time. Initially, I had some issues using Tone.JS, and I explored other web audio API's, such as Howler. What I came to realize after exploration of this web audio API, was that howler did not have a transport function, which then brought me back to implementing Tone.JS.

Reflecting back on the semester, I would say that I learned a great deal regarding web audio as a whole, and also the implementation of audio API's through node. I also came to realize that there is a bright future for web audio technologies, as it is lightweight for users to implement and it could be used for a variety of applications.

Overall, I would say that I accomplished my goals that I had set out to accomplish, which to refer were the following...

1) Deepen understanding of audio manipulation and real-time playback techniques within a web browser environment.
2) Analyze and evaluate the potential of browser-based DAWs for music production and collaboration.
3) Explore the design and implementation of web audio technologies using APIs.

Moving forward I would love to continue working on this project. I have a real passion for audio technology and computer science so this is an ideal application of my technical skills. In the coming month I would like to address the following issues with my code present, which are... Errors when samples are pressed. From what I can tell the code is implemented properly. There just seems to be some sort of issue regarding the actual Tone.JS context.

The next big challenge, moving forward is implementing some sort of visual component to the audio playback. I have been looking into some solutions for this and I think the answer lies within p5.JS. The technology found within p5.JS Provides a creative solution to the issue of creating a visual compontent for audio playback.

In conclusion, I felt as though I gained a tremendous amount from this independent study as it allowed me to explore concepts and ideas that were not a part of the standard curriculum for computer science.
